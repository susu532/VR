# virtual experience

Local prototype that demonstrates embedding an  VR experience into a React app using an `<iframe>`.

Getting started

1. Install dependencies:

```powershell
cd "C:\Users\slayer\OneDrive\Bureau\dior"
npm install
```

2. Start dev server:

```powershell
npm run dev
```

3. Open `http://localhost:5173` and the virtual experience will be visible in the iframe. Replace the placeholder `EMPERIA_URL` in `src/components/EmperiaEmbed.jsx` with your published virtual experience embed URL.

Notes

- This project is a lightweight frontend-only prototype. For production, ensure the virtual experience URL allows embedding on your domain and follow virtual experience's documentation for authentication, if needed.
